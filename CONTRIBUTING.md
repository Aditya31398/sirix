# Contributing

From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is
appreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change
the api please create an issue first. This way we can ensure that your precious
work is not in vain.

## Submitting Changes

After getting some feedback, push to your fork and submit a pull request. We
may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives, but for small changes
your pull request should be accepted quickly.

Some things to consider:

* Write tests
* Follow the existing coding style
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
